Main source code:

https://github.com/TheBlad768/Sonic-Clean-Engine-S.C.E.-

Current issues:

1. S.C.E. uses Kosinski Plus algorithm, but Flex2 program does not support Kosinski Plus Module. Therefore, Flex2.json project is partially useless.

Alternative programs:
- https://github.com/flamewing/mdcomp/releases
- https://github.com/Clownacy/ClownMapEd/releases

2. S.C.E. uses two-byte IDs chunks for layout. Official SonLVL can open level projects, but it only supports one-byte ID. You just won't be able to use more than 0x100 chunks.
You can use ProjectFM's alternative version of SonLVL that supports two-byte IDs and you can use more 0x100 chunks for levels.
